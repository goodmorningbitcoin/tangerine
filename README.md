- **Base Protection**: Full protection on and offline except for twig structures, which are raidable unless upgraded.
- **Hodl Havoc Event**: The monthly event starting the last Friday before wipe, where base protection ends, and players compete to turn in hash at the community center.
- **Sputnik**: A competitive, timed event where players race to compete against attack choppers, NPCs, turrets and of course other players for resources from fallen space fragments.
- **Raidable Bases**: Participate in Raidable Bases events for exciting PvP and rewards.
